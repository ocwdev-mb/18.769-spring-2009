  "course_description": "This course will give a detailed introduction to the theory of tensor categories and review some of its connections to other subjects (with a focus on representation-theoretic applications). In particular, we will discuss categorifications of such notions from ring theory as: module, morphism of modules, Morita equivalence of rings, commutative ring, the center of a ring, the centralizer of a subring, the double centralizer property, graded ring, etc.\n",
